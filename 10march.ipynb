The technique used to formulate null and alternative hypotheses involves identifying whether there is a new claim being made about something which has been established as truth or if someone wants to question existing beliefs and make new claims altogether.2 For example, if a defendant is charged with robbery, the null hypothesis would be that the defendant is not guilty, while the alternative hypothesis would be that the defendant is guilty. The trial's goal would be to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis.1 A hypothesis test uses sample data to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.01\n",
